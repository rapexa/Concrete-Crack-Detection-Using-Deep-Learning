# Concrete-Crack-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model to detect cracks in concrete surfaces, specifically designed to assist site engineers in identifying structural issues early. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for image classification.
